<body>
<p> 
<h3>Summary:</h3>
Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Malark have their names drawn on reaping day and have to fight to their deaths in the capitol city Panem. In the interview Peeta reveals that he’s in love with Katniss and that is their one way ticket for them to both survive The Hunger Games. This plan was set up by 
Haymitch Abernathy who won the second quarter quell (we will talk about that in the SUNRISE AT THE REAPING summary) as an overall plan to overthrow the Capital .They make it out alive and not so in love like their supposed to be. That stirs up suspicion with President Snow, they realize they bit of more than they can chew

<h2>Catching Fire:Book 2</h2>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>Katniss and Peeta are thrown into the third Quarter Quell. As a punishment to the districts, two winners of the hunger games from previous years, from each district are
thrown into the arena again.Just when you think all is lost Haymitch has a plan. What is this plan you ask? Is it to completely destroy the arena? Get revenge on President Snow? Or is it planting the first seed to destroying the capital for good? We will see in Mockingjay( because suzzane leaves us with a cliff hanger) if they are able to do it.</p>
